**HubBox - Enterprise Hub and Web Product Manager** is a business hub or office space booking and web product validation and activation platform, that will help you protect your **PHP, NODE JS, ASP.net script codes** and potentially anything that needs a web browser to run from unauthorized use and theft and also enables you manage and allow customers to make **online bookings** for your business hubs and rented office facilities.
This is perfect for you if you have script **codes distributed via online marketplaces**, and would require that customers who purchase 
your scripts enter an **activation code**, before they are able to use the product and also if you own business hubs and office facilities that you put out for daily rent and would need to allow customers book online and remotely.

**HubBox - Enterprise Hub and Web Product Manager** also allows you to generate and provide custom email addresses using Cpanel for your users and staff allowing them to send, read and manage email messages without leaving the system at a convenience never before seen, users can also login with one click to the webmail interface without the requirement to enter passwords.

#### Advantages of using HubBox
  1. The core is written on the latest version of the Codeigniter framework.
  2. Activation code is only valid for a single domain.
  3. Uses cookies to prevent frequent calls to the validation server.
  4. Can be hosted on Github and served via CDN.
  5. Validation is done outside the validating script, making it rather difficult to break.
  6. Frontend can be re-implemented with calls only made to the validation API.
  7. Can be used for B2B - B2C Validation by installing the B2B Plugin.
  8. Payments can be collected via credit cards with Stripe and Paystack.
  9. Reservations are automated and will activate or expire at the booked time frame.
  10. Booked Hubs can easily be verified with a simple qr-code scan.
